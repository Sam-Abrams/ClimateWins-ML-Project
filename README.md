## Project Overview

**Client**: ClimateWins - European nonprofit organization focused on climate research and prediction  
**Role**: Data Analyst with machine learning responsibilities  
**Objective**: Develop optimal machine learning models for predicting climate consequences and extreme weather events across Europe

This project addresses the growing need for accurate climate prediction tools in the context of increasing extreme weather events. By leveraging machine learning techniques on historical data, it provides actionable insights for climate adaptation and disaster preparedness strategies.

## Business Problem

ClimateWins faces critical challenges in predicting and preparing for climate change impacts:

- **Extreme Weather Increase**: 10-20 year trend of increasing severe weather events across Europe
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited budget requiring targeted, efficient prediction models
- **Geographic Variability**: Different climate patterns across European regions requiring location-specific approaches
- **Long-term Planning**: Need for 25-50 year climate projections to guide policy and safety recommendations

**Key Questions Addressed**:
- Can machine learning accurately predict pleasant vs. unpleasant weather conditions?
- What are the optimal algorithms for weather pattern recognition?
- How do geographic factors affect model performance?
- What patterns exist in 60+ years of European climate data?

## Data

**Source**: European Climate Assessment & Data Set project  
**Coverage**: 18 weather stations across Europe  
**Time Span**: Late 1800s to 2022 (120+ years of historical data)  
**Volume**: 16.6MB CSV with daily recordings  
**Key Variables**: Temperature, wind speed, snow depth, global radiation, atmospheric pressure

**Data Quality**: 
- Near-daily coverage for most recent decades
- Some historical gaps in early 1900s data
- Standardized measurement protocols across stations
- Geographic diversity spanning multiple climate zones

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Supervised Learning Analysis âœ… COMPLETED
**Objective**: Identify optimal supervised learning model for weather prediction

**Methodology**:
- Implemented and compared K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees, and Artificial Neural Networks
- Tested both multi-city and location-specific training approaches
- Applied gradient descent optimization for temperature trend analysis
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices

**Key Discovery**: Location-specific training improves model accuracy by 35-38% compared to multi-city approaches

### Phase 2: Advanced Machine Learning ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Objective**: Apply advanced ML techniques for pattern discovery and long-term prediction

**Planned Implementation**:
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering and dimensionality reduction to identify hidden weather patterns
- **Deep Learning**: CNNs and RNNs for complex temporal pattern recognition
- **Ensemble Methods**: Random forests and support vector machines for robust predictions
- **Generative Models**: GANs for future climate scenario generation
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Advanced tuning for maximum model performance

## Key Findings

### Geographic Specificity is Critical
All models performed **35-38% better** when trained on individual city data rather than multi-city datasets, revealing that:
- Weather patterns vary significantly across European cities
- Location-specific models are essential for accurate predictions
- Geographic factors must be considered in climate modeling approaches

### Model Performance Comparison

| Model | Multi-City Accuracy | Belgrade-Specific Accuracy | Improvement |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **K-Nearest Neighbor** | 50% | **86%** | +36% |
| Decision Tree | 46% | 84% | +38% |
| Neural Network | 46% | 81% | +35% |

### Strategic Recommendations
- **Primary Choice**: K-Nearest Neighbor for single-variable weather predictions
- **Future Application**: Neural networks for multivariate analysis incorporating multiple weather variables
- **Implementation Strategy**: Deploy location-specific models rather than region-wide approaches

## Technologies Used

**Programming & Analysis**:
- Python 3.8+
